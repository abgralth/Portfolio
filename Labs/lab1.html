        <p> This lab assignement wasn't very difficult, the hardest was to basivally learn how to code in Javascript and how to use functions.
        I was really interessing because I learned a lot about how to use developers tools.
        Another tricky point was understanding how a dynamic page work.</p>
   			<div class="title">
   				<h2>Assignement 1</h2>
   			</div>
            <p> a) HTML: HTML is a web language used to write some part of a page.</p>
	          <p>b) CSS: CSS is a language used in web design to modify easily the look of a page and make it more appealing.</p>
	          <p>c)JavaScript: JavaScript is a language used to add more complexity to a page in order to improve the design even more than CSS.</p>
            <p>d)HTTP: HTTP is a protocol which allow a communication between the computer and the server.</p>
            <p>e) HTML5: HTML5 is simply the newest version of HTML which we are most likely going to use.</p>
            <p>f) Dynamic HTML: A HTML page is called dynamic when it can be modified on the run while browsing the page. </p>

         <div class="title">
           <h2>Assignement 2</h2>
         </div>
            <p> Conventions are mostly useful when your code is share or showed to other to help them understand what you write.
              It is much easier in group work to agree on a same kind of syntax in order to have a code much easier to read and, by extension, to correct.
              Also having everyone follow the same kind of conventions could prevent some errors such as encoding.
              I will try to follow the conventions written on Code Guide since it was recommended.</p>

        <div class="title">
          <h2>Assignement 5</h2>
        </div>
          <p> Here is a <a href="Lab_1/html.html">link </a> to the dynamic page </p>
